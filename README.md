# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: inadequate handling of exceptions during asynchronous operations.  The `bug.dart` file shows code vulnerable to silent failures due to unhandled exceptions.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust solution.

## Problem
The original code uses a `try-catch` block but doesn't handle the exception effectively.  Simply printing the error doesn't provide sufficient information for debugging or user feedback.  In a production application, such a failure could go unnoticed, leading to unexpected application behavior.

## Solution
The solution improves error handling by:

1.  More informative error messages:  The exception includes the specific response code and more details.
2.  Custom Exception handling: You can define your own custom exceptions providing specific information about errors for more precise handling.
3.  Consider using packages such as `dio` that offer more advanced features for managing errors effectively, with retry mechanisms and more structured exception handling.
